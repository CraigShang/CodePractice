Find the Difference

Solution
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t)
    {
        ArrayList<Character> chars = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++)
        {
            chars.add(t.charAt(i));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
        {
            chars.remove(new Character(s.charAt(i)));
        }
        return chars.get(0);
    }
}
